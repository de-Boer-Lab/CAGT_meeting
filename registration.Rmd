## Accomodation:

Attendees can reserve their stay on UBC campus **[here](https://suitesatubc.com/)**. Rooms on campus fill up faster during this season, so we recommend reserving your accomodation as soon as you register.

## Cancellation Policy

Attendees can get a full refund if they cancel over 60 days before the conference. Cancellations made between 30 to 60 days prior are eligible for a 50% refund. No refunds are provided for cancellations within 30 days of the event. All cancellation refunds incur a 35 CAD administrative charge.
